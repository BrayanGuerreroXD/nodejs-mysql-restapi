# nodejs-mysql-restapi

The project is a simple REST API that manages employees using Node.js, Express, and MySQL. The API allows CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
on employees using different HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE.

Express is used to create the API routes, and MySQL is used as the database to store and retrieve employee information. 
Each API operation corresponds to a specific route that handles HTTP requests and converts them into SQL queries to interact with the database.

The project was deployed on Railway, a cloud hosting platform, using an automatically generated domain by the 
platform: nodejs-mysql-restapi-production-c345.up.railway.app. This allows the API to be accessible online and usable from anywhere.
